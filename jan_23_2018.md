Arguably, most of the goals you can achieve in Proteus are aesthetic because the game doesn’t have explicit goals of itself. Maybe aside from changing seasons. Collecting animals wasn’t meant to be. The environment is very hard to navigate, and the animals disappear between seasons: going back to a castle where I previously left a frog, I found it empty. The game was showing me its limits, the ways in which it could not be subverted.
